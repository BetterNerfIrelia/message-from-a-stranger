# Message From a Stranger

[![travis ci](https://api.travis-ci.org/betterthingsdigital/message-from-a-stranger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/betterthingsdigital/message-from-a-stranger)

A tiny application that allows to send messages to a slack channel via
an [Incoming Hook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

We've constructed this to have a simple way of doing a coding session with
students who applied for an internship and were invited to visit us.
